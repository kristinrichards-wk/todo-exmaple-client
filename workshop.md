# LINK 2017 Workshop: _Building UI with Web Skin Dart_

**Presenter:** Greg Littlefield

This workshop will provide a comprehensive walkthrough of building a UI using Web Skin Dart, with tips and best practices sprinkled in.

We'll start by building a simple layout composed of existing components, and incrementally build and introduce complex custom components.

Along the way weâ€™ll cover the details of component lifecycle, event handling, debugging using the Chrome and React DevTools, and unit testing of UI.

## How is this workshop going to work?
In this workshop, we'll be tasked with building a UI into an existing repo, within an existing Wdesk experience. w_flux actions and stores are in place, so it'll just be a matter of building UI and wiring it up.

This workshop is formatted as a hybrid presentation and guided codelab. I'll be walking through the process from start to finish, implementing code in an on-screen IDE and using slides to help communicate tips, processes, and other information.

The different steps in the development process are available as branches (see [_Workshop Agenda_](#workshop-agenda) for more info), allowing you to follow along on your own machine, and even skip ahead if you ~~get bored~~ are ambitious.

## Setting up on your machine
- If you haven't done so already check out [Introduction To Dart](https://dev.workiva.net/docs/github/workiva/applicationframeworks/dartintroduction) and install Dart on your machine.

- Open up a browser tab with the [Web Skin Dart Docs](https://docs.workiva.org/web_skin_dart/latest/components/) so that we can quickly reference them later.

- Clone the repo, check out the workshop's first commit, and fetch dependencies.
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:Workiva/todo-example-client.git
    cd todo-example-client
    
    git checkout ui-workshop/start
    
    pub get --packages-dir
    ```
    
    **Make sure to be on the Workiva-LINK17 network, or `pub get` won't work.**

- Serve the app using `pub serve`, open it in Dartium by navigating to <http://localhost:8080/>, and auth using wk-dev's Single Sign-On.

- If nothing went wrong, you should see "Hello world!" within an empty Workspaces shell.

## Workshop Agenda

Listed below are the tasks we'll be performing in this workshop.

> Each step (starting with 2a), is associated with two branches, which correspond the state of the codebase _before_ and _after_ the task has been completed.
>
> [All branches](https://github.com/Workiva/todo-example-client/branches/all?query=ui-workshop%2F) are prefixed with `ui-workshop/` and the task numbering, for convenience.
>
> For example, step 4b is associated with branches `ui-workshop/4b-item-component` and `ui-workshop/4b-item-component_done`


1. Review the visual spec

2. Build the layout
    - a. Lay out content as intended

3. Compose basic UI with WSD - Display todos
    
4. Break up our UI into components
    - a. Split up main app view:
        - i. TodoList 
        - ii. Create todo input
    - b. Todo list items

5. Flesh out component functionality - TodoListItem 
    - a. Add completion checkbox 
    - b. Display notes 
    - c. Wire up expanded behavior 
    - d. Display privacy badge 
    - e. Wire up actions buttons 

6. EditTodoModal component 

7. Polish TodoListItem
    - a. Basic conditional rendering 
    - b. Disable buttons based on permissions 
    - c. Fine-tune block layout padding 
    - d. Custom class names 
    - e. Hide toolbar unless hovered/focused     

8. Unit tests
